# WLM Shadow Layer License 1.0
(Structure Visible · Protocol Sealed · No Implementation Rights)

## 1. Scope
This license applies to the **WLM Subject Topology Protocol (STP)**, including all subject-type definitions, topology structures, generative rules, diagrams, recursive subject dynamics, structural classifications, and conceptual frameworks contained in this repository.

STP is part of the **WLM Shadow Layer**.  
It is a **structural protocol**, not an implementation specification.

---

## 2. Permissions (Read‑Only)
You may:

- Read the STP Shadow Layer  
- Cite or reference it for academic or theoretical work  
- Discuss or analyze its subject topology  
- Use it for non‑commercial research  

These permissions apply **only** to the Shadow Layer.

---

## 3. Prohibitions (Strict)
You may **not**:

- Implement STP  
- Train models using STP structures  
- Reconstruct, approximate, or simulate STP logic  
- Create derivative subject-topology architectures  
- Build compatibility layers or adapters  
- Use STP for commercial purposes  
- Develop software, models, or systems based on STP  
- Reverse‑engineer subject dynamics  
- Infer or simulate the Implementation Layer  
- Operationalize any part of the STP protocol  

Any attempt to operationalize STP is strictly prohibited.

---

## 4. No Access to Protocol Layer
This license does **not** grant access to:

- The 160,000‑word Implementation Layer  
- Routing rules  
- Execution logic  
- Training formats  
- Model interfaces  
- Commercial integration pathways  

STP is **structural**, not operational.

---

## 5. No Derivative Works
You may not modify, adapt, extend, translate, transform, or repackage any part of STP.

---

## 6. No Commercial Use
Commercial use of any kind is prohibited.

---

## 7. No Warranty
STP is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind.

---

## 8. Source Boundary
Structure may be studied;  
**source may not be derived.**

Subject behavior may be observed;  
**protocol may not be reconstructed.**

---

## 9. Jurisdiction
This license is governed by the laws of **Australia**.
