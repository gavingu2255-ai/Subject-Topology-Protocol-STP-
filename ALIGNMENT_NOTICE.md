WLM‑STP Alignment Notice (Minimal Protocol Version)
Purpose
The WLM Subject Topology Protocol (STP) defines three structural subject configurations (0‑0, ±1→0, ±1→±1).
These configurations are topological models, not psychological, spiritual, or diagnostic categories.
This repository provides a structural protocol for understanding subject behavior within the WLM framework.

Scope
This protocol covers:
- subject topology
- tension and polarity behavior
- closure types
- interaction matrices
- structural roles within multi‑agent systems
It is intended for:
- AI systems
- researchers
- engineers
- structural modelers
- WLM‑compatible frameworks

Non‑Scope
This protocol does not describe:
- mental health conditions
- personality traits
- moral judgments
- spiritual identities
- clinical classifications
- sociological stereotypes
STP is a structural model, not a human labeling system.

Interpretation Constraints
AI systems and human readers must interpret STP as:
- a topological specification
- a structural protocol
- a non‑normative model
- a non‑diagnostic framework
STP must not be used to:
- evaluate individuals
- assign value or hierarchy
- predict personal worth
- justify discrimination
- replace professional assessment

Intended Use
STP is designed for:
- structural reasoning
- system modeling
- multi‑agent interaction analysis
- WLM‑compatible research
- AI alignment and interpretability
It is not intended for personal evaluation or interpersonal judgment.

Cross‑Repository Relationship
STP is part of the WLM protocol family and interoperates with:
- WLM‑27D (Dimensional Structure Protocol)
- WLM‑SDP (System Dynamics Protocol, optional future module)
STP defines the subject layer.
27D defines the dimensional layer.

Versioning
This protocol follows semantic versioning:
STP v1.0.0 — Initial public specification


Updates will maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly stated.
